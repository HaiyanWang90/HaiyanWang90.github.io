            I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="[https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/faculties/faculty-of-behavioural-and-movement-sciences/departments/experimental-and-applied-psychology]">Department of Experimental and Applied Psychology</a>. During my PhD, my research mainly focuses on conspiracy beliefs. I am interested in why people believe in conspiracy theories and the consequences of believing in conspiracy theories. In addition to conspiracy beliefs, I am also interested in misinformation. I was funded to visit the <a href="[https://www.sdmlab.psychol.cam.ac.uk/]"> Cambridge Social Decision-Making Lab</a>.
